## Project Planning

- **INIT.md** - Original project planning (Chinese). Background, motivation, and core design goals.
- **PLAN.md** - Phased implementation plan (archived). Tasks for Phases 1-7, test import batches. Outdated.
- **CORE.md** - Core algorithm difference analysis. Detailed comparison between Swift implementation and Mozilla Readability.js.

## Code Review Reports

- **BATCH-1-CLUSTERS.md** - Issue clusters for Batch 1. Defined RW-C1 to RW-C5 taxonomy for classifying real-world failures.
- **BATCH-2-REPORT.md** - Batch 2 results. 11 major news sites, all passed.
- **BATCH-2-CLUSTERS.md** - Issue clusters B2-C1 to B2-C4 for Batch 2.
- **BATCH-4-CLUSTERS.md** - Batch 4 technical content. 12 engineering sites, 6 clusters (C1-C6), all closed.
- **BATCH-5-REPORT.md** - Batch 5 CMS/blog platforms. 11 cases, iterative fixes for C1/C3/C4, all closed.
- **BATCH-5-CLUSTERS.md** - Issue clusters B5-C1 to B5-C4. All marked CLOSED.
